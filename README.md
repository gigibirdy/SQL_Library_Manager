This project was developed with JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Pug, and the SQL ORM Sequelize. The goal is to build a dynamic website to help a library managing their collection of books. The librarian has been using a simple SQLite database stored in library.db and has been entering data in manually.

This web application include pages to list, add, update, and delete books. HTML was implemented following client's design. Pagination and search function is included for the books listing page. Searching can be case insensitive and good for partial matches for strings.
